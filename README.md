# hello-world

Hi 

I am an analytical chemist living in Switzerland. I like to use python not only for data analysis but also to simulate things like acid/base titrations and so on. As a final goal, I would like to offer students and colleagues these things as a web application. For this reason I try to improove my Flask skills.
